        <h4>Sweet Curry With Saffron</h4>
        <p>Lusciously mellow with notes of overripe berries, 55% Hawaiian dark chocolate meets its soulmate in sweet curry - awash in spices including coriander, tumeric, cumin and cardamom and sprinkled with rare saffron. This spicy melange is slowly steeped in fresh coconut puree and gently blended with the chocolate. The taste rushes over you in waves - fragrant curry, chased by coconut, then the lingering, raisiny sweetness of chocolate.

        <h4>Machu Picchu</h4>
        <p>Caramelized cacao nibs, with the bitter hints of the luxurious chocolate it will become, take this truffle to new heights. The nibs are crushed into a ganache of 65% Peruvian chocolate with a light touch of cinnamon and vanilla bean. Gail tops it off with crushed and candied almonds. The interplay of smooth and crunchy make this a warmly indulgent taste trip.

        <h4>Lemongrass with Ginger</h4>
        <p>Inspired by Asian cuisine, this fragrant fusion - featuring mild, buttery 70% Venezuelan chocolate - tastes of lemon groves and the steamy tropical sun. Gail infuses dried organic lemongrass into coconut puree with a few generous scoops of sharp ginger pulp. Topped with candied lemon peel and dried safflower, this meeting of East and West has rapidly become a favorite.

        <h4>Rica Organica</h4> 
        <p>Gail goes to great lengths to secure chocolate from Costa Rica's Upala and Guapiles districts,  visiting the farms herself. Once you taste it, you'll know why. It's muscular, with waves of black olive and toast. With chocolate this extraordinary, a few vanilla beans in fresh cream are all that's needed. This silky smooth meltdown will captivate your entranced tongue.

        <img src="images/flavor-cinnamon.jpg" alt="" />
        <h4>Cinnamon/Cayenne</h4>
        <p>This ancient recipe began the enduring love affair with chocolate - earthy cacao blended with the sweetness of cinnamon and the fire of roasted chilies. Gail uses toasty, nutty 65% Colombian chocolate and a suggestion of cinnamon to lure your taste buds into happy complacency before the heady rush of heat on the finish. It will leave you glowing.

        <h4>Shiitake Mushroom</h4> 
        <p>The warm earthiness of 65% Peruvian chocolate combines with savory shitake mushrooms in the ultimate expression of umami, the fifth taste sensation. Dried shiitakes, steeped with cream, are folded into the chocolate for a mild, fragrant ganache. Bits of mushroom add a pleasantly chewy texture - a deeply satisfying taste experience.

        <h4>Lucille's Vanilla </h4>
        <p>For those who prefer milder chocolate, this winsome truffle will ignite a lifelong love affair. Gail uses a dark blend in this recipe handed down through four generations of the Guittard family of chocolate makers. It tastes like a rich spoonful of homemade chocolate pudding - just like Gail's mom, Lucille, made on the stovetop in their family farm's kitchen.

        <h4>Caramel Sprinkled With Grey Salt </h4>
        <p>Caramelized sugar and warm cream, mixed in small batches, with a little Madagascar vanilla and a pinch of salt. It's simple. It's magic. Gail dips her caramel in smooth Colombian chocolate and sprinkles on gourmet fleur de sel. Deliciously sweet and salty, it's melt-in-your-mouth, swoon-worthy heaven.

        <h4>Raspberry</h4>
        <p>Not to be indelicate, but this is a wet, ripely decadent dream.

The fresh raspberries burst in your mouth, chased by the chocolate's smooth richness.

        <img src="images/flavor-espresso.jpg" alt="" />
        <h4>Espresso</h4>
        <p>The strong, deep flavors of Ecuadorian Arriba chocolate demand an equally strong flavor companion. Gail uses Just Coffee espresso, made from organic, fair-trade beans here in Madison. Arriba's hint of floral rides lightly atop the earthy espresso and chocolate to fully awaken your taste buds.

        <h4>Cognac</h4> 
        <p>Organic ginger pulp, infused in sweet cream, explodes in your mouth with a delightful zing as it meets the sharp, floral taste of Ecuadorian Arriba chocolate. Rich amber cognac coasts along the top of this flavor fusion, finished by the sweet crunch of Australian baby candied ginger. Go ahead, close your eyes and dissolve into its warmth.

        <h4>Cointreau</h4>
        <p>Orange and chocolate are a beloved combination. Gail steeps candied orange peel in sweet cream, adding pure essential orange oil from Mountain Rose Herbs and a dash of Cointreau. The dark boldness of Costa Rican chocolate is the perfect mate for this bright, happy fruit.

        <h4>Blueberry</h4> 
        <p>This joyful dance begins with dried Michigan blueberries, plumped up in sweet cream infused with Rishi's bright Blueberry Rooibos tea. The blueberries and cream coax out the tangy berry notes of 65% Peruvian chocolate. For texture, Gail adds bits of blueberry. Fresh, pure and bountiful. It's summer and chocolate in a rush of giddy flavor.

        <p>Gail pairs the delicate flavor of Rishi's Jasmine Tea with the smoothness of 61% Carenero Superior chocolate. This refined chocolate complements the light floral of the jasmine green tea, infused in fresh cream. It's a subtle, elegant taste that reveals itself softly on your tongue.

        <h4>Earl Grey</h4> 
        <p>Earl Grey is a deliciously complex experience - orange blossom, bergamot, lavender and black tea. When combined with an intricate 70% dark chocolate blend, the distinctive flavors unfold like the themes in a symphony. It reaches a delirious flavor crescendo and then sends you off with a light floral note of organic lavender buds. Lovely.
